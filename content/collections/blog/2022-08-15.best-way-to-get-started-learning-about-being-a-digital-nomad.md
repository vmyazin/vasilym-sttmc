I love learning about ways of being a better traveler and creator. I find the term "digital nomad" a bit cringeworthy, but I'll continue to use it since I don't see any obvious alternatives. There are many stereotypes attached to the term "digital nomad."

For some, it's a fad. For others, it's the way of life.

When I first became aware of the term "digital nomad," I realized I was already one. Meanwhile, many people who are interested in the subject have difficulty figuring out where to start.

## So, if you are trying to learn more about being a digital nomad, here's the best way to get started:

*   **Read This Book:** [Vagabonding](https://rolfpotts.com/books/vagabonding/) by [Rolf Potts](https://twitter.com/rolfpotts) will give you a sense of what long-term traveling and avoiding being a mere tourist can be like. Rolf is about to release another book called [The Vagabond's Way](https://rolfpotts.com/books/the-vagabonds-way/) (can't wait to get my hands on it!). A supplemental (and slightly outdated but still valuable) guide: [The 4-hour Workweek](https://tim.blog/tim-ferriss-books/?_ga=2.158904316.794681944.1660557821-693595879.1660557821#the-4-hour-workweek) by Tim Ferriss.
    
*   **Watch This YouTube Video:** [Living in Buenos Aires, Argentina as a digital nomad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl-oXcQ6Mxs) by [Sergio Sala](https://twitter.com/sergiosa_la) to get a taste of what a digital nomad's life is like. This one is specifically about Buenos Aires, but I'm sharing it to illustrate the main aspects applicable anywhere. Sergio has guides for other cities as well (and he keeps them coming).
    
*   **Listen To This Podcast: Become Nomad** ([Apple Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/become-nomad-digital-nomad-lifestyle-and-long-term-travel/id1051084986)s and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/09ZHkd42SW0fw2MdgwQwhw)) **by Eli David.** If you really want to start going down the rabbit hole, listen to the episode entitled "Finding Spirituality in a Lifestyle of Change" (ep. 83). Eli and his cohost Dan go deep into philosophy, routines, and unexpected angles related to the nomadic lifestyle.
    

These 3 resources will substantially accelerate your process of understanding how you can apply being a digital nomad to your life situation.
