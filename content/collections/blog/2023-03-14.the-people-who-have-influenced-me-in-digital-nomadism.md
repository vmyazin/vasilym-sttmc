I have been interested in information technology vagabondage (a slick alternative to _digital nomad_, huh? ðŸ˜‚) for a while now.

These people have a lot to do with my progress:

Pieter Levels
-------------

The Dutch trailblazer of digital nomadism is a serial entrepreneur and most famously, the creator of [NomadList](https://nomadlist.com/) and [RemoteOK](https://remoteok.com/). Pieter's relentless work to promote the "freedom from the office" lifestyle had a massive impact on me.

His book ["Make"](https://readmake.com/) showed me a radically different approach to building startups.

Eli David
---------

Through his podcast, [Become Nomad,](https://becomenomad.com/category/podcasts/) an Israeli indie entrepreneur, and world roamer, Eli showed me a more spiritual, gentle side of traveling. For me, he has a unique philosophy on:

*   the time required to spend in a new city to feel grounded
    
*   the approach to choosing a city for a better work/life balance
    
*   the importance of disconnecting
    

Johnny FD
---------

Even though I don't always see eye to eye with Johnny, he played a significant role in my understanding of the world of remote workers and indie business creators. He was one of the pioneers of geo-arbitrage while living on the dirt cheap in Thailand ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­ and doing business with his native USA.

By attending Johnny's [Nomad Summit](https://www.nomadsummit.com/) in Chiang Mai, I made a lot of valuable, long-lasting connections. His [business and investment insights](https://www.johnnyfd.com/search/label/Business) educated me on how to make my money work for me.

These people have taught me so muchâ€”and, just like they did with me, I hope to pass my learnings to the next person.
