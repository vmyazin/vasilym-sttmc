**Exercise. Regularly. Get vital benefits. I’m sure you already know that. You are also well aware of how unexpected events can easily disrupt your exercise routine. Even if you have a regular schedule and access to the gym. There is a number of events that can send you into a tailspin. Traveling to a different city or country takes away your habitual routine. Pandemics necessitate gym closures for indefinite periods. Mounting chores at home prevent you from walking (or jogging) to your gym that can be as near as several minutes away.**

If you are anything like me, you just want to have your exercise schedule on auto-pilot. Choose a time, a place, a set of exercises, and stick to them.

## You Should Not Let The Inconveniences Stop You From Working Out

It’s important to keep your body and mind in tip-top shape, especially during volatile times. Living at a stable place with a gym located inside your building sure is nice. With my lifestyle, however, I often don’t have such a convenience.

In the year 2020, additional limitations appeared, and, for many of us, exercising at home or a nearby park became the most viable option.

## Here Are Some Workout Options You Can Start Using Today

Luckily for us, there are alternative methods to keep our bodies in shape. I invited my friend [Alex Pavlovskih](https://www.instagram.com/janrisfitness/), a fitness and nutrition trainer based in Brooklyn, NY, to help me compile a list of effective exercises that you can do:

* at home
* outside
* while traveling

The three basic categories are:

* Bodyweight
* Resistance band
* Reflex ball

## How To Do A Full-Body Workout At Home

Here we got three simple full-body workout routines. You will need [a resistance band](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0827XBXGH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for some of them.

*Glossary for beginners:* **reps**, short for repetitions, are the action of one complete strength training exercise, like one biceps curl. **Sets** are how many reps you do in a row between periods of rest. 

Each exercise is a set of 3 with 8-12 reps. Rest 1 minute between each set.

**Workout A**

1. [Push-Ups](#pushups) 
2. [Front Squats With A Shoulder-Width Stance](#band-squat)
3. [Tricep Bench Dips](#tricep-bench)
4. [Lunges](#lunges)
5. [Face Pull](#face-pull)
6. [Crunches](#crunches)

**Workout B**

1. [Inverted Wrist Push-Ups](#inverted-wrist-push-ups)
2. [Single-Leg Squat](#single-leg-squat)
3. [Biceps Curls Seated](#curl-seated)
4. [Plank](#plank) (30 secs to 1 min)
5. [One-Arm Push-Downs](#arm-push-down)
6. [Wood Chopper](#wood-chopper)

**Workout C**

1. [Overhead Band Extension](#overhead-extension)
2. [Biceps Curls Standing](#curl-standing)
3. [Tricep Bench Dips](#tricep-bench)
4. [Shoulder Shrug](#shrug)
5. [Crunches](#crunches)
6. [Plank](#plank) (30 secs to 1 min)

Tie the band into a knot and jam it in the door for some exercises.

You should do all exercises in a controlled manner, with at minimum a 1.5 sec of contraction, positive and negative. If you aren’t familiar with the terminology, to explain it simply, think of a dumbbell curl. A positive contraction is your arm’s effort on the way up; a negative one is on the way down. During a positive contraction, your muscle fibers shorten. During a negative contraction, your muscle fibers lengthen.
